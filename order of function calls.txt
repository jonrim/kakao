user calls friend, adds room
user gets own media
sets up onMessage (handler) on mount
sets up socket.on(methods)
user: socket.find (creates room, sends back to user socket.create)
user: socket.create

friend: socket.find
friend finds user's room, asks to join
friend: socket.join (*need to add icecandidates here)
user (on join) adds guest to room

friend sends message to user asking to join room (send) (socket.emit(auth)) (make friend automatically run send upon mount (socket.emit(auth)), after find)
user: socket.approve (this is automatic, user now has to accept or reject)

user accepts (handleInvitation) (socket.accept) (change to autoaccept once user adds guest to room, on join. accept in socket.approve)
both run socket.bridge

media.init runs for both


where does onMessage get called????
